Objective:
Build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.

Tools used:
Python, scikit-learn, pandas

Steps:
Load the SMS dataset.
Convert the text data into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Naive Bayes model on the training data.
Predict the labels for the test data.
Evaluate the model using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Output:
The model gives accuracy and classification results to show how well it can detect spam.

Deliverable:
A Jupyter Notebook containing code, results, and explanation.
